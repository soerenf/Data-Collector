Just for educational purpose

I am builduing this app with the purpose to educate users relating to possible information leaks he or she has just by using any app.
So donÂ´t mess with the code and only use it to help people!

The main goal is to outline the course of the day of the user with an app without permissions that are classified as dangerous.
Furthermore the user is supposed to be informed with the help of notifications, what assumptions are made concerning his diffrent actions within his daily life.
This actions are saved in a database within the app and the assumptions can get verified by the user.

This verification process is needed for evaluation if the chosen approach is coorect.
